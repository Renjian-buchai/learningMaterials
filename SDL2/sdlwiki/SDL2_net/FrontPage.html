<p>The latest version of this library is available from <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net/releases.html">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This is an example portable network library for use with SDL. It is available under the zlib license, found in the file <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net/blob/main/LICENSE.txt.html">LICENSE.txt</a>. The API is listed as available functions in <a href="CategoryAPI.html" title="wikilink">CategoryAPI</a>. This library supports UNIX, Windows, MacOS Classic, MacOS X, BeOS and QNX.</p>
<p>The demo program is a chat client and server.</p>
<p>The chat client connects to the server via TCP, registering itself. The server sends back a list of connected clients, and keeps the client updated with the status of other clients. Every line of text from a client is sent via UDP to every other client.</p>
<p>Note that this isn't necessarily how you would want to write a chat program, but it demonstrates how to use the basic features of the network library.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
