<h2 id="llvm-and-intel-c-compiler-support">LLVM and Intel C++ compiler support</h2>
<p>SDL will build with the Visual Studio project files with LLVM-based compilers, such as the Intel oneAPI C++ compiler, but you'll have to manually add the "-msse3" command line option to at least the SDL_audiocvt.c source file, and possibly others. This may not be necessary if you build SDL with CMake instead of the included Visual Studio solution.</p>
<p>Details are here: <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/5186.html" class="uri">https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/5186</a></p>
<h2 id="opengl-es-2x-support">OpenGL ES 2.x support</h2>
<p>SDL has support for OpenGL ES 2.x under Windows via two alternative implementations.</p>
<p>The most straightforward method consists in running your app in a system with a graphic card paired with a relatively recent (as of November of 2013) driver which supports the WGL_EXT_create_context_es2_profile extension. Vendors known to ship said extension on Windows currently include nVidia and Intel.</p>
<p>The other method involves using the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/angleproject/.html">ANGLE library</a>. If an OpenGL ES 2.x context is requested and no WGL_EXT_create_context_es2_profile extension is found, SDL will try to load the libEGL.dll library provided by ANGLE.</p>
<p>To obtain the ANGLE binaries, you can either compile from source from <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle.html" class="uri">https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle</a> or copy the relevant binaries from a recent Chrome/Chromium install for Windows. The files you need are:</p>
<ul>
<li>libEGL.dll</li>
<li>libGLESv2.dll</li>
<li>d3dcompiler_46.dll (supports Windows Vista or later, better shader compiler) <em>or</em> d3dcompiler_43.dll (supports Windows XP or later)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you compile ANGLE from source, you can configure it so it does not need the d3dcompiler_* DLL at all (for details on this, see their documentation). However, by default SDL will try to preload the d3dcompiler_46.dll to comply with ANGLE's requirements. If you wish SDL to preload d3dcompiler_43.dll (to support Windows XP) or to skip this step at all, you can use the SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WIN_D3DCOMPILER hint (see SDL_hints.h for more details).</p>
<p>Known Bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval is currently a no op when using ANGLE. It appears that there's a bug in the library which prevents the window contents from refreshing if this is set to anything other than the default value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vulkan-surface-support">Vulkan Surface Support</h2>
<p>Support for creating Vulkan surfaces is configured on by default. To disable it change the value of <code>SDL_VIDEO_VULKAN</code> to 0 in <code>SDL_config_windows.h</code>. You must install the <a href="https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/.html">Vulkan SDK</a> in order to use Vulkan graphics in your application.</p>
