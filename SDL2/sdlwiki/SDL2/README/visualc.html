<h1 id="using-sdl-with-microsoft-visual-c">Using SDL with Microsoft Visual C++</h1>
<h3 id="by-lion-kimbro-with-additions-by-james-turk">by Lion Kimbro with additions by James Turk</h3>
<p>You can either use the precompiled libraries from the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/download.php.html">SDL</a> web site, or you can build SDL yourself.</p>
<h3 id="building-sdl">Building SDL</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>To build SDL, your machine must, at a minimum, have the DirectX9.0c SDK installed. It may or may not be retrievable from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com.html">Microsoft</a> website, so you might need to locate it <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=directx9.0c+sdk+download&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web.html">online</a>. <em>Editor's note: I've been able to successfully build SDL using Visual Studio 2019 <strong>without</strong> the DX9.0c SDK</em></p></li>
<li><p>Open the Visual Studio solution file at <code>./VisualC/SDL.sln</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Your IDE will likely prompt you to upgrade this solution file to whatever later version of the IDE you're using. In the <code>Retarget Projects</code> dialog, all of the affected project files should be checked allowing you to use the latest <code>Windows SDK Version</code> you have installed, along with the <code>Platform Toolset</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose <em>NOT</em> to upgrade to use the latest <code>Windows SDK Version</code> or <code>Platform Toolset</code>, then you'll need the <code>Visual Studio 2010 Platform Toolset</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Build the <code>.dll</code> and <code>.lib</code> files by right clicking on each project in turn (Projects are listed in the <em>Workspace</em> panel in the <em>FileView</em> tab), and selecting <code>Build</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may get a few warnings, but you should not get any errors.</p>
<p>Later, we will refer to the following <code>.lib</code> and <code>.dll</code> files that have just been generated:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./VisualC/Win32/Debug/SDL2.dll</code> or <code>./VisualC/Win32/Release/SDL2.dll</code></li>
<li><code>./VisualC/Win32/Debug/SDL2.lib</code> or <code>./VisualC/Win32/Release/SDL2.lib</code></li>
<li><code>./VisualC/Win32/Debug/SDL2main.lib</code> or <code>./VisualC/Win32/Release/SDL2main.lib</code></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note for the <code>x64</code> versions, just replace <code>Win32</code> in the path with <code>x64</code></em></p>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-with-sdl">Creating a Project with SDL</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a project as a <code>Win32 Application</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a C++ file for your project.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the C runtime to <code>Multi-threaded DLL</code> in the menu: <code>Project|Settings|C/C++                  tab|Code Generation|Runtime Library</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the SDL <code>include</code> directory to your list of includes in the menu: <code>Project|Settings|C/C++ tab|Preprocessor|Additional include directories</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>VC7 Specific: Instead of doing this, I find it easier to add the include and library directories to the list that VC7 keeps. Do this by selecting Tools|Options|Projects|VC++ Directories and under the "Show Directories For:" dropbox select "Include Files", and click the "New Directory Icon" and add the [SDLROOT]\include directory (e.g. If you installed to c:\SDL\ add c:\SDL\include). Proceed to change the dropbox selection to "Library Files" and add [SDLROOT]\lib.</em></p>
<p>The "include directory" I am referring to is the <code>./include</code> folder.</p>
<p>Now we're going to use the files that we had created earlier in the <em>Build SDL</em> step.</p>
<p>Copy the following file into your Project directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SDL2.dll</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Add the following files to your project (It is not necessary to copy them to your project directory):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SDL2.lib</code></li>
<li><code>SDL2main.lib</code></li>
</ul>
<p>To add them to your project, right click on your project, and select <code>Add files to project</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of adding the files to your project, it is more desirable to add them to the linker options: Project|Properties|Linker|Command Line and type the names of the libraries to link with in the "Additional Options:" box. Note: This must be done for each build configuration (e.g. Release,Debug).</strong></p>
<h3 id="hello-sdl2">Hello SDL2</h3>
<p>Here's a sample SDL snippet to verify everything is setup in your IDE:</p>
<pre><code>    #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;

    int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
    {
        const int WIDTH = 640;
        const int HEIGHT = 480;
        SDL_Window* window = NULL;
        SDL_Renderer* renderer = NULL;

        SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
        window = SDL_CreateWindow(&quot;SDL2 Test&quot;, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, WIDTH, HEIGHT, SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);
        renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED | SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC);

        SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
        SDL_Quit();
        return 0;
    }</code></pre>
<h3 id="thats-it">That's it!</h3>
<p>I hope that this document has helped you get through the most difficult part of using the SDL: installing it. Suggestions for improvements should be posted to the <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues.html">Github Issues</a>.</p>
