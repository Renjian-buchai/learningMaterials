<p>The latest version of this library is available from <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases.html">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This is a simple library to load images of various formats as SDL surfaces.</p>
<p>It can load BMP, GIF, JPEG, LBM, PCX, PNG, PNM (PPM/PGM/PBM), QOI, TGA, XCF, XPM, and simple SVG format images. It can also load AVIF, JPEG-XL, TIFF, and WebP images, depending on build options (see the note below for details.)</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="CategoryAPI.html" title="wikilink">CategoryAPI</a> for a list of functions, and the examples <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/blob/main/examples/showimage.c.html">showimage.c</a> for documentation on this library.</p>
<p>This library is under the zlib License, see the file <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/blob/main/LICENSE.txt.html">LICENSE.txt</a> for details.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for AVIF, JPEG-XL, TIFF, and WebP are not included by default because of the size of the decode libraries, but you can get them by running external/download.sh</li>
<li>When building with CMake, you can enable the appropriate SUPPORT_* options defined in CMakeLists.txt.</li>
<li>When building with configure/make, you can build and install them normally and the configure script will detect and use them.</li>
<li>When building with Visual Studio, you will need to build the libraries and then add the appropriate LOAD_* preprocessor define to the Visual Studio project.</li>
<li>When building with Xcode, you can edit the config at the top of the project to enable them, and you will need to include the appropriate framework in your application.</li>
<li>For Android, you can edit the config at the top of Android.mk to enable them.</li>
</ul>
