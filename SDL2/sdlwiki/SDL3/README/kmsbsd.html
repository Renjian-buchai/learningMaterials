<p>KMSDRM on *BSD ==================================================</p>
<p>KMSDRM is supported on FreeBSD and OpenBSD. DragonFlyBSD works but requires being a root user. NetBSD isn't supported yet because the application will crash when creating the KMSDRM screen.</p>
<p>WSCONS support has been brought back, but only as an input backend. It will not be brought back as a video backend to ease maintenance.</p>
<p>OpenBSD note: Note that the video backend assumes that the user has read/write permissions to the /dev/drm* devices.</p>
<h1 id="sdl-wscons-input-backend-features">SDL WSCONS input backend features</h1>
<ol>
<li>It is keymap-aware; it will work properly with different keymaps.</li>
<li>It has mouse support.</li>
<li>Accent input is supported.</li>
<li>Compose keys are supported.</li>
<li>AltGr and Meta Shift keys work as intended.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="partially-working-or-no-input-on-openbsdnetbsd">Partially working or no input on OpenBSD/NetBSD.</h1>
<p>The WSCONS input backend needs read/write access to the /dev/wskbd* devices, without which it will not work properly. /dev/wsmouse must also be read/write accessible, otherwise mouse input will not work.</p>
<h1 id="partially-working-or-no-input-on-freebsd">Partially working or no input on FreeBSD.</h1>
<p>The evdev devices are only accessible to the root user by default. Edit devfs rules to allow access to such devices. The /dev/kbd* devices are also only accessible to the root user by default. Edit devfs rules to allow access to such devices.</p>
